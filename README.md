## Install Dotfiles

To install the dotfiles, you first need to set the `DOTFILES_DIR` environment variable. After that, clone this repository to the `DOTFILES_DIR` directory.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/eeternalsadness/dotfiles.git $DOTFILES_DIR
```

Run the `init-dotfiles.sh` script. After this has been set up, you just need to pull the latest changes to the `dotfiles` repository to get the latest changes.
