# dotfiles

A repository to store my dotfiles. It contains the configuration for the following:

- Neovim (default LazyVim with plugins that I use)
- Tmux
- Bash & Zsh
- Stuff that I use on Arch Linux (Hyprland, Kitty, Qutebrowser, Waybar)

This is meant to be used with my [devbox config](https://github.com/eeternalsadness/devbox) and my [scripts](https://github.com/eeternalsadness/scripts).
